Welcome to Memory Monkey, a pre-curriculum Rithm project to practice DOM manipulation using vanilla javascript.

## Assignment: JavaScript and the DOM, Part II

For this assignment, you’ll be building a memory game in the browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Your goal is to build a card-based memory game.

Players will be shown a collection of cards, face down, and can click on a card to reveal what’s underneath. After clicking on two cards, the game should check to see whether they match. If they do, they will remain facing up. If not, the cards should remain displayed to the player for a couple of seconds, and then flip back down. The goal of the game is to match up pairs of cards in as few clicks as possible.

Be sure to style your game! It should be functional but also look nice.

**Requirements**

1. As a player, I can start a new game.
2. As a player during the game, I can click on a card to reveal what’s underneath it.
3. As a player during the game, I can see the total number of times I have turned over cards by clicking on them.
4. As a player, I should only be able to see at most two cards at a time.
5. As a player, I should not be able to click on the same card twice and have that count as a guess.
6. As a player, after clicking two cards that are not a match, I should be able to see them both for at least 1 second before they flip over again
   (7. Bonus) Store the lowest-scoring game in local storage, so that players can see a record of the best game played.

**Make sure you use vanilla JavaScript only - no frameworks or third-party libraries.**
